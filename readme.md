# Smart security detector for smart lab: a proposal for an Embedded system to safe monitor chemical laboratory.
## What is? 
IotProjectUnical is an Iot project made by Luigi Rachiele for university exam purpose, founded on Low Embedded Programming with some concept of IoT Security.
To better understand the project, read the [doc file](https://github.com/Gixs/IotProjectUnical/blob/main/doc/Embedded_Project_214894_Luigi_Rachiele.pdf).

## Folder description
- **android_app**: source code of the android app, that function as a dashboard for the user.
- **arduino**: low level programming code of the _Atmega328p_ microprocessor, built in the arduino board.
- **doc**: documentation folder where there are LaTeX source code of the documentation and the export of the documentation.
- **esp8266**: arduino uses an _ESP8266_ to send data sensed to the Cloud. This is the folder with the code used.
- **node-RED**: as flow manager it is used Node-RED. There is the flow used.
