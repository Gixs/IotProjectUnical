### Arduino UNO

[ ...TODO... ]

### ESP8266

The ESP8266 receives from the UART the data from the Arduino UNO and sends it using the Trasport Layer Security (TLS). The connection to the cloud is established using the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol enriched with the TLS (Transport Layer Security) security protocol. This combination ensures a secure and protected connection between the ESP8266 device and the cloud. By using the generated certificates and stored in the device flash memory, the ESP8266 device can establish a secure connection with the cloud. These certificates allow for the verification of the device and server identities in the TLS handshake process, thereby preventing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Cloud

The cloud section focuses on the cloud infrastructure and services employed in the IoT Security project. It includes various components critical to the IoT Security project, including the MQTT broker, database, and the utilization of Node-RED for data flow management.

The cloud is managed using a Digital Ocean droplet that serves as the central point of the project.

### MQTT Broker - Mosquitto

The MQTT broker plays a pivotal role in facilitating communication between the IoT devices and the cloud services. It acts as a central hub, receiving messages from the devices and distributing them to the relevant cloud services. The MQTT broker's implementation includes robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the transmitted data. This involves the use of secure authentication protocols, access controls, and encryption techniques to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

The chosen MQTT broker for the project is Mosquitto. The communication between the different subscribers is secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security). Additionally, username and password authentication is implemented to ensure authorized access to the MQTT broker.

To manage the TLS protocol, Certbot is utilized, and the project obtains certificates through "Let's Encrypt". The obtained certificates are associated with the domain "iotprojectunical.me", which is acquired from the namecheap website.

By leveraging TLS, username and password authentication, and obtaining certificates from Let's Encrypt, the project establishes a secure and encrypted communication channel between the MQTT broker and the subscribers. This setup ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the transmitted data within the IoT Security project.

### Database

In the database section, we discuss the database management system utilized in the IoT Security project.

The database utilized in the project is MySQL. However, for the encryption of the database, a deliberate decision was made not to employ Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). Instead, a manual approach to data encryption was deemed more suitable for educational purposes. Consequently, the data is manually encrypted using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm before being inserted into the database.

By employing manual encryption, the project gains greater control over the encryption process and can apply specific encryption techniques tailored to its requirements. This approach allows for the secure storage of sensitive data within the database.

When retrieving the data from the database, it can be decrypted, enabling various functions and operations to be performed on the decrypted data. This provides the necessary flexibility for data analysis, manipulation, and processing while maintaining the security of the sensitive information.

The decision to opt for manual data encryption with DES rather then of TDE demonstrates a purposeful choice made within the project for educational purposes. It offers insights into the manual encryption process and provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of data encryption techniques and their implementation within a secure environment.

### Node-RED

Regarding Node-RED, it is also hosted in the cloud. It is protected by username and password authentication, and access to it is secured using the HTTPS protocol through the implementation of the Nginx web server.

Node-RED plays a crucial role in managing the flow of data within the project. Data is received by Node-RED through MQTT, ensuring secure communication with TLS encryption. From there, the data is directed towards two main destinations. Firstly, it flows towards the dashboard, which provides a visual representation of the data for monitoring and analysis. Secondly, the data is routed towards the encryption phase, where it is encrypted before being securely stored in the database.

By employing username and password authentication and implementing HTTPS through Nginx, Node-RED ensures secure access and communication. The integration with MQTT, along with TLS encryption, guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of the data as it traverses through the system. The combined functionalities of Node-RED, MQTT with TLS, and the secure storage of data in the database contribute to the overall security of the IoT Security project.

## Northbound

The Northbound section of this report focuses on the applications that transparently utilize the data generated by the physical devices for visualization and interaction. This section encompasses two key components: the Android App and the Node-RED Dashboard.

### Android App

The Android App serves as a user-friendly interface, allowing users to access and interact with the IoT system. It seamlessly integrates with the data generated by the physical devices, providing real-time updates, control options, and visualizations. The Android App employs robust security measures, including secure user authentication and encrypted communication, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between the app and the IoT system.

### NodeRED Dashboard

The Node-RED Dashboard complements the Android App by providing an additional platform for data visualization and interaction. It offers a customizable and intuitive interface that allows users to monitor and control the IoT system's data flow in real-time. The Node-RED Dashboard incorporates security features, such as secure access controls and encrypted communication channels, to safeguard the data as it flows between the IoT system and the dashboard.

The Northbound section highlights the significance of the Android App and the Node-RED Dashboard in enabling users to effectively visualize and interact with the data generated by the physical devices. By ensuring the security and usability of these applications, the IoT system becomes more accessible and user-friendly, empowering users to make informed decisions based on the insights derived from the data.
